# RGB-Color-Game
Hello there!
 The motive of this game is to correctly guess the three-digit RGB color code.
 For e.g: (0,0,0) is the color "BLACK" and (255,255,255) is the color "BLACK"
 The first digit represents the amount of "RED" in the given color.
 The second digit represents the amount of "GREEN" in the given color.
 The third digit represents the amount of "BLUE" in the given color.

 There are two modes: EASY and HARD.
 EASY contains only 3 colors to choose and the HARD mode has six colors.
 
 GUESS THE COLOR CORRECTLY AND WIN THE GAME!
 Cheers to You! Hasta la Vista!
